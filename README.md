# SMSBackupXMLParser

**Written and designed by:** Ian A. Gardea

---

**Requirements:** 
Python 3.8

**Description:** 
This program will search for, and extract data from XML files generated by the Android application "SMS Backup & Restore". 

**Note:** 
For now, this program will only parse XMLs produced by the SMS Backup application, because it is only looking for a specific XPath.
I may expand on this in the future. It was a quick development that I only made for personal needs.

**Instructions:**
Before using this program, collect the XMLs that you would like to extract data from, and place them in the "input" folder. 

Launch the program.
A GUI will appear with the following text fields:
Date - A text field that accepts any date in the format MM/DD/YYYY. (e.g. 01/01/2001)
Name - A text field that accepts any first and last name. (e.g. John Smith) 

Click the submit button to submit parse the XML file(s). The text matching the search criteria will be copied to a file called "output.txt".

If any errors or unexpected behavior occurs, a "debug.log" will be generated for each run in the src folder.
